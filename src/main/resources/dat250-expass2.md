# Report DAT250

## Challenges
* We struggled to have all the imports of @Controller, @Getters and @Setters imported correctly. The way we solved it was to ensure that all the packages were written correctly
* We also had problems to display "index.html". We managed to do this by ensuring that HomeController.Java was written correctly.

## To do
* Implement all the html sides so that they are not empty
* Actually have the components work as intended. We have set up the different components, however, the logic is not yet working.
